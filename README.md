# MIT 15.456 Project 1

This repository contains the **code, analysis notebook, and output plots** for **MIT 15.456 – Financial Engineering** Project 1.  
The materials here are used to simulate and compare different hedging strategies, including delta hedging and the zero/one strategy, and to analyze their performance under varying drift and time step conditions.

## Contents
- `project_1.ipynb` – Main Jupyter notebook containing simulation code and analysis  
- `.png` files – Generated plots illustrating hedge errors, drift impacts, convergence, and sample paths  
- `.ipynb_checkpoints/` – Auto-saved notebook checkpoints (can be ignored)

## Usage
All results can be reproduced by opening and running `project_1.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab with standard Python scientific libraries (`numpy`, `matplotlib`, etc.).

## Note
This repository is for academic purposes as part of MIT 15.456 coursework.
